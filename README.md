# Afrobeats

In this project I wanted to show the growth (or a lack thereof?) of the music genre Afrobeats via various parameters (Playlist Followers, YouTube channel subscriptions, festival line-ups).

I've heard from many people within media companies I or other people have worked at that Afrobeats is not "known enough", "niche" etc. This always seemed weird to me.
But I wanted to see if I just was living in a bubble where this genre is very popular or if I in fact was right and people just (for whatever reason) don't acknowledge 
the genre's influence.

Long story, short: Afrobeats is in fact a worldwide growing phenomenon with millions of fans worldwide.

I used data I got via the Chartmetrics API (Spotify Playlist followers and Youtube Top Countries for certain artists) and I scraped multiple websites.
After that I made three graphics, one of them via Datawrapper that became a scrollytelling graph via ai2html, and the other two visualizations were made via D3.

The D3 Visualisations were the most challenging of this project but I have a much better understanding now. Also, I am happy I got to scrape for this
project, which was also at times not very easy. But I learnt new skills, like e.g. scraping multiple webpages at once.
