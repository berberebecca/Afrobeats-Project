## Afrobeats

In this project I wanted to show the growth (or a lack thereof?) of the music genre Afrobeats via various parameters (Playlist Followers, YouTube channel subscriptions, festival line-ups).

I've heard from many people within media companies I or other people have worked at that Afrobeats is not "known enough", "niche" etc. This always seemed weird to me.
But I wanted to see if I just was living in a bubble where this genre is very popular or if I in fact was right and people just (for whatever reason) don't acknowledge 
the genre's influence.

# Methodology:

I used data I got via the Chartmetrics API (Spotify Playlist followers and Youtube Top Countries for certain artists) and I scraped multiple websites.
After that, I made three graphics, one of them via Datawrapper that became a scrollytelling graph via ai2html, and the other two visualizations were made via D3.
To one of them I added a hovering element as well, which I really wanted to try just to prove that I can do it.

I am happy that I got to do a D3 Visualisation for my second Lede project and also was scraping a lot of data/collecting data via an API. 
This was also the first time I built a scraper, that scraped multiple webpages at once, which luckily functioned very well.
 
Result:
Long story, short: I was right! Afrobeats is in fact a worldwide growing phenomenon with millions of fans worldwide (Read the article, though!).
